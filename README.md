### Hospital Administration Analysis

This project addresses the critical challenge of hospital readmissions, which negatively impact patient health outcomes while significantly increasing healthcare costs. By analyzing patient demographics, medical history, treatment patterns, and admission trends, the study aims to identify key risk factors associated with repeated hospital visits within short time intervals.The case study involves cleaning and analyzing real-world healthcare data to examine relationships between variables such as age, comorbid conditions, treatment type, medication usage, prior admission frequency, and post-discharge follow-up care. Through exploratory data analysis, visual analytics, and predictive modeling, the project uncovers patterns that enable hospitals to identify high-risk patients and intervene proactively before readmission occurs.The findings indicate that readmissions are strongly influenced by multiple interrelated factors, including advanced age, chronic illnesses, frequent prior hospital visits, medication intensity, and inadequate post-discharge follow-up. Patients with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disorders demonstrate a significantly higher likelihood of readmission. Predictive modeling proved effective in categorizing high-risk patients, supporting early intervention and preventive care planning.Based on these insights, the project delivers actionable recommendations, including improved discharge planning, personalized follow-up programs, enhanced monitoring of vulnerable patients, and optimized care pathways. Overall, the analysis demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance patient care strategies, optimize resource utilization, and substantially reduce hospital readmission rates—ultimately benefiting both healthcare providers and patients.

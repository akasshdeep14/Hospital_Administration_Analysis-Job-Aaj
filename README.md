### Hospital Administration Analysis
​
This project aims to reduce the rate of hospital readmissions, a major challenge that impacts patient health outcomes and increases medical costs. By analyzing patient data, treatment history, medical conditions, and admission trends, the goal is to identify key risk factors responsible for repeated hospital visits within a short period.

The case study involves cleaning and examining real-world healthcare data to explore relationships between variables such as age, comorbidities, treatment type, medication usage, and follow-up care. Through visual analytics and predictive modeling, the project seeks to detect patterns that help hospitals proactively intervene before a patient is readmitted.

The outcome of this analysis will lead to actionable recommendations, such as optimized discharge planning, targeted follow-up programs, better monitoring of high-risk patients, and improved care pathways. Overall, the project demonstrates how data-driven insights can improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance patient care strategies, and significantly lower hospital readmission rates.

The findings of the analysis reveal that hospital readmissions are strongly influenced by multiple interrelated factors, including age, chronic diseases, previous visit frequency, medication dosage, and lack of post-discharge follow-up. Patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or respiratory issues showed the highest tendency for readmission. Predictive modeling proved effective in categorizing high-risk patients, allowing hospitals to intervene earlier.

By improving monitoring systems, customizing discharge instructions, and prioritizing follow-up care for vulnerable patients, hospitals can significantly reduce readmission rates. The project highlights how integrating data-driven decision-making within healthcare systems leads to improved patient outcomes, optimized resource utilization, and reduced financial burdens for both hospitals and patients.

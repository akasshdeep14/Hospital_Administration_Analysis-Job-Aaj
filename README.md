### Hospital Administration Analysis

Project Purpose
•	This project focuses on reducing hospital readmissions, which can harm patient health and increase healthcare costs.
•	The goal is to understand why patients return to the hospital within a short time and identify those at high risk early.
•	By using data, the project aims to help hospitals take preventive action before readmissions happen.
Key Findings
•	Readmissions are more likely among patients who:
o	Are older in age
o	Have chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or respiratory issues
o	Have frequent prior hospital visits
o	Take multiple or intensive medications
o	Receive insufficient follow-up care after discharge
•	Certain health conditions significantly increase the risk of repeat hospital visits.
•	Predictive models successfully flagged high-risk patients, enabling early intervention.

How Hospitals Can Use These Insights
•	Improve discharge planning to ensure patients leave with proper care plans
•	Create personalized follow-up programs for vulnerable patients
•	Monitor high-risk patients more closely after discharge
•	Optimize care pathways to prevent unnecessary readmissions
•	Allocate hospital resources more efficiently
